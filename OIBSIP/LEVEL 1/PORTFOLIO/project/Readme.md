Full-Stack Developer
Always Curious For New Tech...

I am a Full-Stack developer based in Midnapore, India. I am currently pursuing MCA from the University of North Bengal. I have a serious passion for UI effects, animations, and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.I am a well-organized person, a problem solver with high attention to detail. I am interested in the entire front-end spectrum and enjoy working on ambitious projects with positive people. Apart from being a developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. I love to play cricket When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows and web series, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology.
